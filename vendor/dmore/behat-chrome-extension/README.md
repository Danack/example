Chrome Behat Extension
======================

Behat extension for controlling chrome without the overhead of selenium.

It communicates directly with chrome over HTTP and WebSockets, which allows it to work at least twice as fast as chrome with selenium.

For chrome 59+ it supports headless mode, eliminating the need to install a display server, and the overhead that comes with it.

This driver is tested and benchmarked against a behat suite of 1800 scenarios and 19000 steps. It can successfully run it in less than 18 minutes with chrome 60 headless.

The same suite running against chrome 58 with xvfb and selenium takes ~60 minutes.

## Installation:

```bash
composer require dmore/behat-chrome-extension
```

## Requirements:

* Google chrome or chromium running with remote debugging

Example:

```bash
google-chrome-stable --remote-debugging-address=0.0.0.0 --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

or headless (59+):

```bash
google-chrome-unstable --disable-gpu --headless --remote-debugging-address=0.0.0.0 --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

The official docker image includes chrome 60 running headless.

See https://gitlab.com/DMore/behat-chrome-skeleton for a fully working example.
